## Who is it for
Anyone that needs a quick and intuitive keyboard-only application launcher that does not rely on spotlight indexing.

## Why
If you are like me and have a shit-ton of files on your computer, and spotlight keeps your CPU running like crazy.

1. [Disable spotlight](https://www.google.com/search?q=disable+spotlight+completely) completely and its global shortcut (recommended but not necessary)
3. Download and run dmenu-mac

## How to use
1. Open the app, use cmd-Space to bring it to front.
2. Optionally, you can change the binding by clicking the ... on the right of the menu.
3. Type the application you want to open, hit enter to run the one selected.

## Examples

You can customize the colors
